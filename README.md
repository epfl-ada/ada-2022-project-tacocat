## Abstract
It's no secret that knowing the right people in the film industry is very important to have a successful film career. But who are these people? In this project we will be analysing the acquitances of each actor, actress, director and writer to further investigate the existence of clusters of people who know each other, why these clusters exist and who are the key people that bridge different clusters. Our main goal is to create a social map of the film industry. To do so, we will build a graph of relationships with clusters. Then, we will dive into interesting clusters to understand their demographic (age, race, genre etc.) and the key people who connect clusters. What happens *behind the scenes* in the film industry is usually a mystery, so we want to *reveal the curtain* to understand the dynamics of the industry.

## Research Questions
- Are there clustering between the people in the film industry?
    - What are common attributes of people in the same cluster? And do we see clusters within clusters? If so, do sensitive attributes such as age, gender and race have anything to do with it?
    - Which people are connecting clusters? What makes them special?
- As representation and diversity have more space in conversations, do we see this in the film industry?
